# localtunnel-server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/localtunnel/server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/localtunnel/server)

localtunnel exposes your localhost to the world for easy testing and sharing! No need to mess with DNS or deploy just to have others test out your changes.

This repo is the server component. If you are just looking for the CLI localtunnel app, see (https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel).

## DNS Setup ##

Set server IP address as A record for `*.example.com` 

### setup

```shell
# server set to run on port 1234
node bin/server --port 80 --host example.com
```


### use your server

You can now use your domain with the `--host` flag for the `lt` client.

```shell
lt --host http://example.com --port <local_port_to_expose>
```

You will be assigned a URL similar to `heavy-puma-9.sub.example.com:1234`.

If your server is acting as a reverse proxy (i.e. nginx) and is able to listen on port 80, then you do not need the `:1234` part of the hostname for the `lt` client.

## REST API

### POST /api/tunnels

Create a new tunnel. A LocalTunnel client posts to this enpoint to request a new tunnel with a specific name or a randomly assigned name.

### GET /api/status

General server information.
